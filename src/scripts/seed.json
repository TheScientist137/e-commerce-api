  {
   "type": "Achromat",
   "description": "Achromats represent the classic, popular, modern lens telescope design. An achromat consists of not one but of two objective lenses, usually made of crown glass and flint glass, and have the effect of a positive and a negative lens."
  },
  {
   "type": "Apochromat",
   "description": "Apochromats are refractors whose lenses are laid out in such a way as to combine at least three colours at a common focal point. This suppresses the chromatic aberration that is typical of refractor telescopes. Without this correction, bright objects like the Moon or the planets would have disruptive colour fringes."
  },
  {
   "type": "Newton",
   "description": "The Newtonian Reflector, named after Isaac Newton, is the absolute classic reflector telescope. The main mirror, which collects light and reflects it, is located at the lower end of the tube. The smaller secondary mirror is located in the top section. It deflects the light by 90°. The focuser, in which one can deploy an eyepiece or camera in order to focus the image, is also located here. The advantage of this system is that there are no lenses involved, and therefore no chromatic aberration arises. In addition, this design offers the largest aperture for the money."

   "type": "Alt-azimuth with GoTo",
   "description": "With an altazimuth mount, a telescope can be slewed upwards and across the horizon. This horizontal angle is also called azimuth. Altazimuth mounts can be quite simply constructed, similar to a photographic tripod. The term GoTo describes a computer control with a database. The motorised system allows you to select and automatically point at objects. The motors also take care of the tracking: the selected object always remains visible in the eyepiece."
  },
  {
   "type": "Equatorial without GoTo",
   "description": "Equatorial mounts are so designed that one axis can be aligned parallel to the Earth's rotational axis. This means that the telescope only has to be rotated about this axis - called the hour axis - to compensate for the Earth’s rotation, allowing the selected astronomical object to always remain centred in the eyepiece. In order to align the hour axis parallel to the Earth's rotational axis, the direction of north and the latitude of the observing site must be known. If the equatorial mount has a polar finder, then this may be used to easily align on the Pole Star."
  },
  {
   "type": "Equatorial with GoTo",
   "description": "Equatorial mounts are so designed that one axis can be aligned parallel to the Earth's rotational axis. This means that the telescope only has to be rotated about this axis - called the hour axis - to compensate for the Earth’s rotation. This allows long exposure times during astrophotography without experiencing the annoying ‘field rotation’ effect. The GoTo control allows astronomical objects to be selected from the built-in database. The motors then automatically slew the telescope to align with the object selected and keep it automatically centred in the eyepiece or on the camera sensor."

   "description": "This wide field refractor is of course an ideal telescope for wide field observing, providing a compact portable telescope giving a sharp, high-contrast image for taking with you on holiday. With an 80mm aperture and 600mm focal length, this doublet ED telescope has high performance optics, offering astrophotographers a fast optical system with its f 7.5 aperture ratio. The use of FPL-53 ED glass means that there is almost no colour aberration. ED glass (extra low dispersion) has very low colour dispersion and a low refractive index. Excellent correction of chromatic aberration is achieved by the combination of this special glass with other optical glass. Improved contrast is achieved by the use of crown glass from the German firm of Schott. The metallic high transmission coating applied to the lenses ensures high light transmission. Photographers get their money's worth, as objects such as the Andromeda Galaxy or the famous Pleiades open cluster work particularly well at this focal length. The tube is equipped with a robust 2 inch Crayford focuser with 1:11 ratio for fine focusing - especially important for astrophotography. The telescope can be used as a guide scope and as an ideal second imaging device for astrophotographers. It is ideal to use with an autoguider due to its short focal length. The refractor can also be turned into a powerful spotting scope for nature observing by the connection of suitable accessories. Also, the telescope is visually a little gem, boasting an elegant design of the highest calibre, with the tube and finder scope gleaming in an aesthetically pleasing tone of black and the white dew shield and the tube rings acting as stylish contrasting elements within the overall design.",

Despite its small size, the mount has computer control (GoTo) to track astronomical objects with your telescope or camera. This is achieved via the built-in WLAN (WiFi). The mount generates a Wi-Fi signal that allows you to connect to your smartphone or tablet. You can then control the telescope via Skywatcher's SynScan app for Android or via iOS. The SynScan app allows you to use the GoTo system to select from around 10,000 astronomical objects. The mount must first be aligned to the night sky for this to function. The app offers several methods that make it easy even for beginners to carry out the alignment. You do not require any previous astronomical knowledge. What's more - the app does not simply allow you to select astronomical objects, the software also recommends objects of special interest and helps with identifying objects. As the SynScan app uses the graphical user interface of your mobile device, operation is much more simple and intuitive than when using the hand controls supplied with classic mounts. The AZ-GTi is equipped with the patented FreedomFind encoder technology. This ensures that the mount will not lose its orientation even if you move the telescope or camera manually. So you can slew to near the object manually and let the GoTo do the final fine adjustment. This much quicker and also saves on electricity. And as regards electricity - you can operate the mount using batteries or with a 'Powertank' (DC 7.5 ~14V, 0.75A, tip positive). The mount can be connected to most camera tripods via the standard 3/8 photo screw.",
